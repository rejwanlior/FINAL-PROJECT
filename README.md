## 📖 Overview
This project is a high-performance personal portfolio designed with a modern, "Dark-Mode" aesthetic. The goal was to create a fast, accessible, and user-focused platform that represents my brand as a developer.

The site features a custom-built navigation system, a dynamic "About Me" section, and a curated gallery of featured projects, each with a dedicated case study. It includes a fully functional contact system and integrated social media links.

## 🎓 What I Learned
Developing this central hub sharpened my skills in professional UI/UX:

* **Brand Identity:** Creating a cohesive look and feel using a specific color palette (Navy & Green) and consistent typography.
* **Component-Based Logic:** Building reusable CSS classes and structures for project cards and "fancy lists."
* **Form Integration:** Implementing `Getform.io` to handle server-side logic without a dedicated backend, ensuring a reliable contact method.
* **Interactive Elements:** Mastering CSS transitions and `backdrop-filter` effects for a premium, high-tech feel.

## 🚀 Continued Development
I plan to keep evolving this portfolio as I grow:

* **JavaScript Enhancements:** Adding smooth-scroll libraries and advanced intersection observers for "reveal-on-scroll" animations.
* **Dark/Light Toggle:** Implementing a theme switcher using CSS variables and local storage.
* **Project CMS:** Eventually migrating to a framework like React or a CMS for easier project management.
